# Fanwork Prompt App
A simple app to generate random prompts for fanworks based on .txt lists

This is a standalone application that generates random prompts. It doesn't require Python or any other dependencies to be installed. 

## How to Run

1. Download and double click on 'Prompt_App.exe' to run the application.
2. You will be asked if you want to use your own prompt lists or the default ones, you can use all default (by choosing 'No' when prompted), all your own (by choosing 'Yes' and selecting your own .txt files) or a mixture (by choosing 'Yes', then selecting files for the sections you want to use your own lists and 'Cancel' for the sections you are happy with the defaults).
3. Only .txt files can be used (these can be written in the Notepad application on Windows). The .txt files used are for fandoms, pairings, AUs, characters, locations, and tags.
4. I have used random fandoms, pairing, characters, tags, AUs and locations from femslash heavy fandoms and various top 100 lists on AO3. I did go through the tags to remove anything that stood out as potentially upsetting, but these are AO3 pairings and tags, many from fandoms I know little about, so there may be some things that people do not like within them. 

Note: Windows Defender will highlight the file as a threat concern, please do run the file through whichever virus software you have to reassure yourself it is nothing more than a Prompt App. Alternatively, use the Python code I have provided to make your own app so you can see the code yourself. I have included more detailed information on running .py files over in my fandom stats section.

Enjoy generating random prompts!
